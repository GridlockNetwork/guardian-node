# Running a Gridlock Guardian Node

[‚Üê Back to README](../README.md)

## Getting Started

To run an official Gridlock guardian node, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Request Access

Contact guardian-onboarding@gridlock.network to request your unique credentials for connecting to the official Gridlock network.

**Note**: Due to high demand, we are currently prioritizing applications from users who hold 5000 LOCK tokens or more.

### Step 2: Configure Your Node

Once you receive your credentials, you'll need to:

1. Set up your configuration file with the provided credentials
2. Run the Docker container with your custom configuration

For detailed information on customizing your node configuration, see the [Customization and Development Guide](./customization_and_development.md).

### Step 3: Monitoring and Rewards

Once your node is running, Gridlock users can select you as their guardian. The system monitors your node's uptime and rewards you monthly based on the number of users who have chosen you as their guardian.
