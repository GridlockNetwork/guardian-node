# Gridlock Guardian Node

The guardian node is the heart of the Gridlock network. It stores part of a user's private key and works together with other guardian nodes to approve transactions and recover accounts. This distributed approach removes single points of failure, which is the root cause of most crypto loss.

Anyone can run one or more guardian nodes. You can run them to protect your own assets or participate in Gridlock's main network and help protect othersâ€”earning rewards in the process.

To understand how the full system works, see [SystemOverview.md](./SystemOverview.md).

## Quick Start

The easiest way to see the full setup in action is to use the [Gridlock CLI](https://github.com/GridlockNetwork/gridlock-cli), which can run both the orchestration node and three guardian nodes with a single command.

Alternatively, you can run the single Docker image:

```
docker run --rm --name guardian-node --network gridlock-net \
  gridlocknetwork/guardian-node:latest
```

To run three guardian nodes (useful when running the example in [gridlock-cli](https://github.com/GridlockNetwork/gridlock-cli)), you can use docker compose:

```
docker compose up
```

For detailed customization options, local development setup, and advanced configuration, see [Customization and Development Guide](./customization_and_development.md).
